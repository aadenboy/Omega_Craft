# Omega Craft
A quick mod for the game Infinite Craft on the neal.fun website.

It's pretty basic so far, but more features may be added in the later future.

# Setup
Setting up this mod is simple. Simply go to the [Infinite Craft website](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/), open the console with F12, and paste in the mod.js script. Four buttons should appear at the bottom right.

# Features
### Adding Elements
You can add a custom element by clicking the + button. Doing so will ask for the element name and emoji. The element emoji is not required, and can be left blank.

### Removing Elements
Removing an element is as simple, by clicking the - button, it will ask for the element to remove.

### Making elements First Discoveries
This works on any element. Clicking the $ button will ask for the element, and then it'll toggle the "First Discovery" field on or off. Any existing copies of the element on the playing area will not automatically update.

### Resetting Progress
**Be careful, you can't undo this!**

To reset all progress, click the red X button, and respond with yes. Any elements on the playing area will not automatically be removed.
